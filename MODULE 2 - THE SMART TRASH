20EC5203  ELECTRONIC DESIGN PROJECT- I
MODULE 2 - THE SMART TRASH

<ABSTRACT>

The Smart Trash project introduces an automated, touchless trash bin system that enhances hygiene by using infrared sensors
to detect human presence and automatically open the lid. It reduces physical contact, minimizes germ spread, and optimizes waste disposal. 
The system includes real-time feedback to alert users when the bin is full or needs maintenance, offering a sustainable, 
energy-efficient solution for waste management in high-traffic areas like parks, malls, and office buildings.

<INTRODUCTION>

The Smart Trash project addresses the growing need for efficient and hygienic waste disposal systems, particularly in high-traffic public spaces. 
Traditional trash bins often require manual operation, which can lead to hygiene concerns, user discomfort, and improper waste disposal. 
This project proposes an automated solution using infrared sensors to detect human presence and open the bin lid without physical contact, 
thus reducing the spread of germs and promoting cleaner environments. By automating the process, the system ensures that waste is disposed of properly, 
while real-time feedback alerts users when the bin is full or needs maintenance. 
Designed for ease of use, energy efficiency, and minimal maintenance, the Smart Trash system aims to improve waste management in public parks, 
malls, offices, and other high-traffic areas, contributing to healthier, cleaner spaces and reducing human error in waste disposal.

<OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE>

*OBJECTIVE
Enhance Hygiene: Develop a smart trash bin that minimizes physical contact, reducing the spread of germs and promoting cleaner public spaces.
Improve Waste Disposal: Encourage proper waste disposal by making it easier and more convenient for users to access the bin.

*SCOPE
Design and Development: Create a prototype of the smart trash bin, incorporating infrared sensors, touchless operation mechanisms, and an automatic closing feature.
Deployment: Plan for the installation of smart trash bins in strategic locations, such as parks, malls, and public buildings. Develop a user feedback mechanism
to gather insights for future improvements and enhancements.
